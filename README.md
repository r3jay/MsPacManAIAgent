# Ms. Pac-Man AI Agent

This project is a custom AI agent for the classic arcade game **Ms. Pac-Man**, developed in **Java**. The agent was programmed to autonomously navigate the maze, avoid ghosts, and maximize score through smart pathfinding and decision-making strategies.

---

## 🤖 Features

- **Autonomous agent** that plays Ms. Pac-Man using internal logic
- **Dynamic decision-making** based on game state (ghost proximity, pellet value, etc.)
- **Pathfinding algorithms** to efficiently navigate the map
- Real-time evaluation of threats and power-ups
- Developed using a provided Ms. Pac-Man framework

---

## 🧠 AI Strategy

- **Finite State Machine** (FSM) to manage behavior modes (chase, flee, collect, etc.)
- **A* Pathfinding** to locate the safest and shortest routes to pellets or away from ghosts
- **Reactive behavior** when ghosts are nearby (prioritizing escape routes)
- **Hunting mode** when ghosts are vulnerable (after eating a power pellet)
- Score optimization through intelligent pellet prioritization

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java
- Ms. Pac-Man AI Framework (legacy academic edition)
- IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse (IDE)

---

## 📁 Structure

- Soon to be updated.

## 🎮 How to Run

> ⚠️ This project uses a custom Ms. Pac-Man framework. Instructions for setting up and running the agent will be added shortly.

---

## 📚 Notes

This project was developed as an academic exercise in AI and game agent design. It's meant to demonstrate problem-solving, decision logic, and efficient path navigation in a real-time game environment.
